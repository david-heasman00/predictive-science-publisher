# predictive-science-publisher
Hi there. 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. During 2025 I interviewed for a Senior Data Analyst role for a large scientific publisher. 

The final stage was a business case study asking you to identify which customers were at risk of churning. 

This required the use of predictive analytics.

My solution to the case study led to a job offer, but I chose a different organisation that was more aligned to my career journey.

This was a fun project, and I learned how to use predictive analytics to solve real business problems. I specifically learned how to use a Market Basket Analysis, or Association Rule Mining with the apriori algorithm to get the results I needed. 

(Association Rule Mining is a form of machine learning). 

## What did you learn?

* How to one-hot encode data for analysis techniques that require data to be in `true` or `false` form. Also how to use qcut to bin continuous data into discrete quartile bins.
* My first machine learning project.
* How to use Association Rule Learning with data representative of a real business problem.

## Where can I view the code?
